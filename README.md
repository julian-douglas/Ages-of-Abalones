# Ages of Abalones

I have just completed the Codecademy Data Scientist Career Path, and the final project was to summarise all of the data science techniques into one study. 

I wanted to choose a topic that was dear to me, such as a dataset containing the health effects of veganism, but a problem is that veganism has not been around for very long, and so there aren't many comprehensive, long-term studies on it. The next option was to use the dataset from the famous China Study, but that dataset is impossible to find on the internet! So, I settled for the ubiquitous abalone dataset.

This project aims to see whether or not the age of an abalone can be calculated using its other features, such as height and weight, because current methods of working out the age involve removing the shell, thereby killing the abalone. As a result, there are machine learning, data visualisation, and statistics techniques in there.
